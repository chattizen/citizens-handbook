## Parks

The parks division oversees more than 60 city parks, recreational facilities, trails and attractions. Its inventory amounts to 4,800 acres of public space, from large well-known areas like Ross's Landing to smaller neighborhood parks.

## Garbage and Recycling

The division manages residential curbside services for garbage, brush, household hazardous waste and recycling. It also oversees the city's landfill and drop-off facilities.  

## City Engineering and Water Quality

Engineering provides planning, design, and construction management for city projects. The water quality program is responsible for ensuring that the city achieves compliance with state and federal clean water laws.

## Waste Resources

Waste resources manages the city's interceptor sewer system and the Moccasin Bend Wastewater Treatment Plant. Much of that infrastructure is also used by neighboring municipalities throughout the metropolitan area.
