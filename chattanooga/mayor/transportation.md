Administrator Blythe Bailey

The Transportation Department manages the city's transportation network and conducts long-term transportation planning. It works with other transportation agencies like the Regional Planning Agency, Chattanooga Airport and CARTA.

It consists of two divisions: traffic engineering and traffic operations. Engineering designs how traffic signals, guardrails and other infrastructure will be implemented. Operations handles the actual installation and maintenance of that infrastructure.
