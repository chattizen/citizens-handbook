Administrator: Todd Leamon

The public works division maintains Hamilton County's public infrastructure and oversees major capital projects.

Public works also provides regulatory oversight for the unincorporated areas of the county and some of its municipalities.

The division consists of three departments — building inspection, engineering and highway — but also encompasses other services like recycling, water treatment and managing sales and lease agreements for county-owned properties.
