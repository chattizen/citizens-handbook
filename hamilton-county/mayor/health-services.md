The department conducts health inspections of restaurants. And it collects and analyzes countywide health data for other governments, departments and agencies.

In addition to executing state policies, the health department also follows the recommendations of the [Regional Health Council](http://health.hamiltontn.org/RHC/Default.aspx), an advisory board of local health care providers, elected officials and citizens.
