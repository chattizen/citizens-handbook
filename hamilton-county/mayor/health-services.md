The health services division is better known as the Chattanooga-Hamilton County Health Department. It serves as the local liaison for Tennessee's Department of Health. It administers state and federal health programs and enforces TDOH regulations. Much of the division's funding comes directly from the state.

The health department provides clinical health care, dental care and case management for residents. It archives certain medical records, including birth and death certificates.

The department conducts health inspections of restaurants. And it collects and analyzes countywide health data for other governments, departments and agencies.

In addition to executing state policies, the health department also follows the recommendations of the [Regional Health Council](http://health.hamiltontn.org/RHC/Default.aspx), an advisory board of local health care providers, elected officials and citizens.

The health services division consists of five departments: administrative services, environmental health, case management, clinical services and community health services.
