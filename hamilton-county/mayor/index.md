The mayor is the chief executive of Hamilton County government. He is popularly elected every four years.

He steers the overall direction of county government and is responsible for managing daily operations. He executes the policies of the state of Tennessee and the County Commission, primarily through the delivery of government services to the public and other offices in county government.

He is the county's chief financial officer and is responsible for its financial assets and liabilities. He presents the county's budget to the County Commission each year and requests money from the county trustee to fund operations.

He has some oversight of the County Commission. He sits on the commission as a non-voting ex officio member. He signs resolutions into law, or if he chooses, vetoes them.

Additionally, Hamilton County's mayor, like the mayor of Chattanooga, is a member of several regional boards and commissions. This aspect of the county mayor's office gives him a great deal of influence over initiatives that affect the entire region.

The mayor is expected to take a leadership role for the whole county. He makes decisions, appoints members of his administration and has a bird's-eye view of county government. He has a full-time staff that handles much of the day-to-day operations of his office. And he has a large administration that handles the actual delivery of government services.
