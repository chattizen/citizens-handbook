### Voting

The County Commission makes decisions on resolutions by a simple majority vote. Each commissioner represents one district. Each district effectively has one vote.

### Officers and Committees

Once a year, the County Commission elects one of its members to be the chair and one to be the chair pro tempore. The commission chair conducts meetings, oversees the agenda and determines the flow of discussion. The chair pro tempore fills that role when the chair is absent.

Most resolutions are discussed in a committee meeting before they are voted on. Since much of the commission's business deals with appropriations, many of its resolutions are discussed in the Finance Committee. There are other committees that correspond to some of the other functions of county government.

### Public Comment

There is a time reserved for public comment at the end of commission meetings. During this time, county residents may address all nine commissioners on issues they feel are important, excluding zoning, and were not addressed in that particular meeting.
