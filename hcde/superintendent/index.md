The superintendent, or director of schools, heads the Hamilton County Department of Education. He is appointed by the Board of Education. He is responsible for executing federal, state and local education policies and laws in the local school system.

Rick Smith was named HCDE's superintendent in 2011.

The superintendent is not a voting member of the school board, but he, and the department he oversees, works closely with it in drafting local education policy. He serves on the executive committee, along with the board chairman, and keeps members updated on issues in local schools and the school system.

The superintendent supervises local public schools, oversees personnel, prepares HCDE's annual budget and makes regular reports to school board members and state officials.
