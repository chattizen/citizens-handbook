                <p>The Hamilton County Board of Education is a legislative and policy-making body that manages and controls the public school system.</p>

                <p>The board consists of nine elected representatives. Board members are elected from the districts they represent. The districts coincide with the Hamilton County Commission.</p>

                <p>Members serve staggered four-year terms — approximately half of the board is elected every two years — and they are not term-limited. School board elections are nonpartisan.</p>

                <p>The school board has four main responsibilities: hire a superintendent; make personnel and infrastructure decisions; submit an operating budget to the Hamilton County Commission; and provide for student enrollment.</p>
