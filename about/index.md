title: About Chattizen
---

Chattizen is a citizen's guide to local government in Chattanooga, Tenn. 

Low voter turnout has become a common, yet unfortunate, refrain in our elections. Yet local government plays an important role in determining the quality of life here.

One of the reasons for this disconnect is the lack of basic information about local government. We created these tools and resources to help you navigate important public institutions.

With Chattizen, you can find out [how your tax dollars are spent](http://taxreceipt.chattizen.org) or learn how local government works in [Chattanooga](../chattanooga) and [Hamilton County](../hamilton-county). We also have a [calendar of public events](https://www.google.com/calendar/embed?src=tfm1lo8jl8kvh2rhr9kf3bl2tk%40group.calendar.google.com&ctz=America/New_York) and a [blog](http://chattizen.tumblr.com) to stay up-to-date on this project.

We welcome your feedback to make Chattizen better. Send us an email, follow us on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/itypewords) and [Facebook](http://facebook.com/chattizen), or fork our tools on [Github](https://github.com/chattizen).

Chattizen is funded with a grant from the [Benwood Foundation](http://benwood.org).
