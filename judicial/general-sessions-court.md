The general sessions court covers civil disputes and misdemeanors.

The court hears civil cases in which the damages are estimated to be below $25,000. The court's criminal jurisdiction is limited to preliminary hearings for felonies and misdemeanors in which the defendant has waived the right to a trial by jury.
