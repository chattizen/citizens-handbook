The public defender provides legal counsel to people who are accused of crimes and cannot afford a private attorney.

She counsels, advises and represents indigent clients on pre-trial matters, trials and appeals in criminal and general sessions courts. The office also represents minors in juvenile court.

A court's judge determines if a defendant qualifies to be represented by the public defender.
