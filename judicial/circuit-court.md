The circuit court covers a wide range of civil cases, including suits for damages, contractual disputes, domestic relations cases and worker's compensation.

Because it has general jurisdiction, the circuit court plays an all-purpose role in the judicial system in Hamilton County. If the jurisdiction of a case is unclear or isn't explicitly assigned to another court, it is heard in circuit court.
