        <p>Tennessee's 11th Judicial District covers Hamilton County and consists of four courts and two attorneys. Two courts of limited jurisdiction are also included here.</p>

        <dl>
          <dt>
            <h2>Chancery Court</h2>
          </dt>
          <dd>
            <p>Chancellor Pam McNutt Fleenor, Part I<br>
               Chancellor Jeffrey Atherton, Part II</p>

            <p>The chancery court covers civil cases of an equitable nature, including conflicts over property, financial assets, debt and contracts.</p>

            <p>There is some overlap between chancery and circuit courts in Tennessee. Where a civil case is filed typically depends on the amount of money involved, the nature of the case, and the preference of the filing attorneys.</p>

            <p>For chancery court records, contact the <a href="http://www.hamiltontn.gov/courts/ClerkMaster/Default.aspx">master and clerk's office</a> at (423)209-6600.</p>

            <p>The circuit court covers a wide range of civil cases, including suits for damages, contractual disputes, domestic relations cases and worker's compensation.</p>

            <p>Because it has general jurisdiction, the circuit court plays an all-purpose role in the judicial system in Hamilton County. If the jurisdiction of a case is unclear or isn't explicitly assigned to another court, it is heard in circuit court.</p>
